# 🛡️ Incident Response Samples and Templates

This repository serves as a collection of professional, audit-ready templates and documentation samples for various stages of the Incident Response (IR) lifecycle, aligning with industry best practices (e.g., NIST SP 800-61, ISO 27001).

These templates are designed to streamline the documentation process during and after a security incident, ensuring all necessary information for Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and compliance is captured.

## 📁 Repository Contents

The repository is structured to provide immediate utility for IR teams:

### 1. Incident Reporting Templates
